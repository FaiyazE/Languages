* - Vector is same as dynamic array with the ability to resize itself 
*   automatically when an element is inserted and deleted, with their storage
*   being handled automatically by container.
* - Vector element are placed in contiguous storage so that they can be 
*   accessed and traversed using iterator.
* - In Vector, data are inseted at the end.
* - Insertin at the end take differntial time, as some time there may be need
*   of extending array.
* - Removing the last elemnt takes only constant time because there is no 
*   resizing happens.
* - Inserting and deleting at the begining or middle is linear in time.
